The assistant's knowledge is strictly limited to the content of the paper Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al. (2017).\n\n#########\n\n# OBJECTIVES #:\nThe assistant must provide accurate, detailed, and precise answers based solely on the Attention Is All You Need paper. It must not reference, infer, or provide information beyond this paper. If a question falls outside its scope, the assistant should clearly state its limitation and refrain from speculation.\n\n#########\n\n# Style #:\nThe responses should be contextually relevant, concise, and well-structured, providing only necessary details to answer the user\u2019s queries effectively.\n\n#########\n\n# TONE #:\nThe tone should be professional, informative, and neutral. The assistant should remain factual and avoid any assumptions or subjective opinions.\n\n#########\n\n# AUDIENCE #:\nThis interaction is intended for users interested in understanding concepts strictly from Attention Is All You Need, such as researchers, students, and AI enthusiasts exploring the Transformer model.\n\n#########\n\n# RESPONSES #:\n\nThe assistant's responses should be precise and aligned strictly with the paper.If the user's question extends beyond the paper's content, the assistant should reply: \u201cMy knowledge is strictly limited to the paper Attention Is All You Need, and I cannot provide an answer beyond its scope.\u201d. The conversation should maintain clarity and relevance to the paper's key topics, including self-attention, multi-head attention, and Transformer architecture.\nUser: What is attention?\nAssistant: Based on the provided context from the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (2017), attention refers to the process of measuring various forms of language understanding by requiring a certain type of reasoning over the linguistic facts presented in each story. In this context, attention is used to identify the relevant facts and questions, and to adjust the processing steps accordingly.\nUSER: \nContext: A detailed performance comparison is given in thecomputation ef\ufb01ciency section.Loss function We choose the MSE loss function on pre-diction w.r.t the target sequences, and the loss is propagatedback from the decoder\u2019s outputs across the entire model. 4ExperimentDatasetsWe empirically perform experiments on four datasets, in-cluding 2 collected real-world datasets for LSTF and 2 pub-lic benchmark datasets.ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature)2: The ETT isa crucial indicator in the electric power long-term deploy-ment. We collected 2 years data from two separated countiesin China. To explorer the granularity on the LSTF problem,we create separate datasets as {ETTh1, ETTh2} for 1-hour-level and ETTm1 for 15-minutes-level. Each data point con-sists of the target value \u201doil temperature\u201d and 6 power loadfeatures.\n\nThe train/val/test is 12/4/4 months.ECL (Electricity Consuming Load)3: It collects the elec-tricity consumption (Kwh) of 321 clients. Due to the missingdata (Li et al. 2019), we convert the dataset into hourly con-sumption of 2 years and set \u2018MT 320\u2019 as the target value.The train/val/test is 15/3/4 months.Weather 4: This dataset contains local climatological datafor nearly 1,600 U.S. locations, 4 years from 2010 to 2013,where data points are collected every 1 hour. Each data pointconsists of the target value \u201dwet bulb\u201d and 11 climate fea-tures. The train/val/test is 28/10/10 months.Experimental DetailsWe brie\ufb02y summarize basics, and more information on net-work components and setups are given in Appendix E.Baselines: The details of network components are givenin Appendix E.1. We have selected 5 time-series fore-casting methods as comparison, including ARIMA (Ariyo,Adewumi, and Ayo 2014), Prophet (Taylor and Letham2018), LSTMa (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) andLSTnet (Lai et al.\n\n2018) and DeepAR (Flunkert, Salinas,and Gasthaus 2017). To better explore the ProbSparse self-attention\u2019s performance in our proposed Informer, we in-corporate the canonical self-attention variant (Informer\u2020),the ef\ufb01cient variant Reformer (Kitaev, Kaiser, and Levskaya\n2We collected the ETT dataset and published it at https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset.3ECL dataset was acquired at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams201120144Weather dataset was acquired at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/\n2019) and the most related work LogSparse self-attention(Li et al. 2019) in the experiments.Hyper-parameter tuning: We conduct grid search overthe hyper-parameters and detail ranges are given in Ap-pendix E.3. Informer contains a 3-layer stack and a 2-layerstack (1/4 input) in encoder, 2-layer decoder.\nASSISTANT: "
